# Crypto Button

## Overview
Crypto Button is an advanced web3 application developed with Next.js and TypeScript, featuring Ethereum blockchain transaction capabilities via MetaMask integration. This project showcases dynamically priced buttons on a web interface, where each button represents a unique blockchain transaction. Upon user interaction, these buttons facilitate direct Ethereum transactions to a predefined wallet, and post-transaction, their status updates to "Sold."

This application serves as a model for implementing web3 transactional interfaces and is designed for private use. However, the codebase is available under the MIT License for educational and development purposes.

## Key Features
- **Ethereum Blockchain Integration:** Seamless interaction with Ethereum through MetaMask.
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Real-time display of transaction amounts on interactive buttons.
- **Transaction Completion Indicator:** Automatic update of button status to "Sold" upon successful transaction completion.
- **Next.js & TypeScript Framework:** Utilizing the robustness of Next.js combined with the safety of TypeScript.
